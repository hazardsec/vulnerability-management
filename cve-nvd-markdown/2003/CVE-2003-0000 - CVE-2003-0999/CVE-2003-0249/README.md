## Description
| Language | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| en | "** DISPUTED **  PHP treats unknown methods such as ""PoSt"" as a GET request, which could allow attackers to intended access restrictions if PHP is running on a server that passes on all methods, such as Apache httpd 2.0, as demonstrated using a Limit directive.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by the Apache security team, saying ""It is by design that PHP allows scripts to process any request method.  A script which does not explicitly verify the request method will hence be processed as normal for arbitrary methods.  It is therefore expected behaviour that one cannot implement per-method access control using the Apache configuration alone, which is the assumption made in this report.""" |
